This was conveyed by the Minister of Public Works and Housing (PUPR), who is also the Acting Head of the IKN Authority (OIKN), Basuki Hadimuljono, when met at Taman Ismail Marzuki, Jakarta, on Thursday (August 8, 2024). "The two are from China and Japan. It's in the housing and property sector. Not just housing, there are hotels and offices," said Basuki.

He revealed that OIKN has received 472 Letters of Intent (LoIs) from potential investors. After selection and evaluation, the number was reduced to 220 LoIs. "According to the previous evaluation, only around 220 can be considered as investors, as the others include contractors, consultants, and suppliers. I have asked for a response so they are not left hanging but get answers," Basuki stressed.

Meanwhile, 45 investors have shown their seriousness, marked by the implementation of the groundbreaking for stages 1-6. "Of the 220, 45 have already done the groundbreaking. This afternoon, I will invite the remaining ones that have been evaluated. There are around 60 in progress, and we will try to accelerate this further," Basuki stated.

        date: "04 Aug 2024",
        content: `JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com – Gold is often the primary choice for beginners who want to start investing. The reason is simple: gold investment is relatively easy to understand and has stable characteristics that are beneficial. Additionally, gold prices tend to be stable and often increase, making it a relatively safe choice compared to other investment instruments.

Gold is known as a "safe haven" or an asset considered safe during unstable economic conditions.

Gold is also resistant to inflation, so its investment value is not easily eroded by rising prices of goods and services. The ideal type of gold for investment is bullion, not jewelry. This is because bullion has a higher pure value and is not subject to additional costs, such as manufacturing fees.

Tips for Gold Investment for Beginners

According to Sahabat Pegadaian, here are some tips for investing in gold bullion for beginners:

Choose a Trusted Place to Buy
Make sure you buy gold bullion from official and trusted places, such as PT. Antam or PT. Pegadaian. Buying from official places ensures that you receive physical gold bullion complete with a certificate of authenticity from PT. Antam, which simplifies the resale process in the future.

Monitor Gold Price Trends
Before buying or selling gold bullion, pay attention to gold price trends and the latest news regarding gold investments. Buying gold when the price drops and selling it when the price rises can maximize profits. Always check the buyback value, as it is usually lower than the market selling price.

Keep Gold for the Long Term
Gold bullion should be kept as a long-term investment. Don’t expect large profits in a short period, as gold prices take relatively long to experience significant increases.

Ensure the Authenticity of the Gold
When buying gold bullion, always check the authenticity of the product. Gold from PT. Antam usually comes with an official certificate that includes the gold's serial number. Make sure the number on the certificate matches the one engraved on the bullion.

Store Gold in a Safe Place
Keep your gold bullion in a safe place. If you only have a small amount of gold, you can store it in a secure deposit box at home. However, if you have a large quantity, consider storing it in a financial institution such as Pegadaian or a bank. Although there may be storage fees, your security and peace of mind should be the priority.

Those are the tips for gold bullion investment for beginners. Before making any investment decisions, always do your research and consult with a financial expert if needed.

        thumbnail: Nearly,
        date: "5 Sep 2024",
        content: `The price of gold is approaching IDR 1.4 million per gram. For those with limited investment capital, digital gold can be a solution for investing in gold with a small amount of capital. With digital gold, your gold investment journey becomes more practical and easy. You can buy gold in very small quantities without having to visit a store.

However, you cannot purchase digital gold carelessly because the platform you are using may not meet legal requirements.

If you're interested in investing in digital gold, follow the three steps below:

1. Check licensing at Bappebti  
   The first step you should take is to check the licensing of the digital gold investment provider.  
   Digital gold trading companies are required to have an operating license from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti). The names of companies that have obtained licenses are listed at bappebti.go.id/pedagang_emas.

   Some criteria for companies deemed eligible to receive an operating license include:
   - Being legally incorporated as a limited liability company (PT)
   - Having a system and mechanism for physical digital gold transactions
   - Possessing capital of IDR 20 billion and being able to maintain a final capital of IDR 16 billion or ⅔ of the total gold managed
   - Digital gold traders must deposit a certain amount of gold with a storage manager, consisting of 10 kg, with 75% in physical gold and 25% in cash.

2. Investigate the track record of the digital gold provider  
   If the provider already has licensing, the next step is to check the company's track record from various sources. You can do this by reviewing news in the media or checking complaints on social media, if available.

   This investigation can be very useful to understand how the company serves its users.

3. Determine how much to allocate for digital gold investment  
   The ideal amount of money to set aside for digital gold investment will depend on your financial condition.

        title: "Benefits of Living Near a Mall, Living a Comfortable Life and High Investment Opportunities",
        thumbnail: Benefits,
        date: "18 Aug 2024",
        content: `Living in a residence close to shopping malls, especially in the midst of the hustle and bustle of big cities with traffic jams and pollution, feels like finding an oasis of calm in an urban desert. In addition to supporting a modern lifestyle, living in such a location also offers many other benefits for daily life, ultimately creating invaluable comfort.

So, what are these benefits? Here's a review:

 1. Easy access to various daily needs
Living near a mall provides easy access to a variety of daily necessities. From basic needs, such as groceries and clothing, to secondary needs, like electronics and household appliances, everything can be found in one place.

You don't need to spend time and energy moving from place to place. You can simply walk or take a short drive to get what you need. Additionally, malls nowadays not only function as shopping centers but also as entertainment and recreational hubs. With various facilities like cinemas, restaurants, cafes, children's playgrounds, and sports arenas, residents living near malls can easily enjoy their leisure time without having to travel far.

This is certainly a plus, especially for families who want to spend time together without the hassle of looking for distant entertainment venues.

 2. Improved mobility and access to transportation
Malls are typically integrated with various public transportation facilities, such as buses, taxis, and even train stations. This means having a residence near a mall offers easy mobility, particularly for those who frequently travel for work or other reasons.

Moreover, if the mall is located in the city center, access to key places like offices, schools, and hospitals becomes easier to reach. This allows you to save time and transportation costs.

 3. Safer and well-maintained environment
Malls are generally managed with strict security standards, including 24-hour surveillance systems and security personnel at various points. If you live near a mall, the surrounding environment will also benefit from enhanced security.

In addition, the area around the mall is usually better maintained due to the attention given by mall managers and local government authorities. Thus, you can feel safer and more comfortable living in a well-organized neighborhood.

 4. Easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle and enrich social life
As is known, some malls provide sports facilities such as gyms, yoga studios, and jogging tracks. If you live near a mall, maintaining a healthy lifestyle becomes easier. You can exercise anytime without having to spend extra money on transportation or memberships at distant fitness centers.

Moreover, healthy food options at malls are also becoming more diverse, making it easier for you to maintain a good diet. Living near a mall also opens up opportunities to enrich your social life. Malls often become gathering places for various communities, from hobbies and sports to social activities. With numerous events and activities frequently held, you can meet new people, expand your network of friends, and even get involved in beneficial activities.

 5. Property value appreciation
Living near a shopping center is not just about convenience; it can also increase the appreciation of property value, particularly if you plan to sell or rent it out in the future.

According to a survey by Attom Data—a real estate and property data provider—published by Go Banking Rates on Thursday (12/1/2022), homes located near shopping centers have the highest average value of USD 987,923. Furthermore, such homes also impact home equity, with owners typically obtaining the highest average value of 50 percent.

The survey targeted homes in the United States (US) located near shopping centers such as Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, and Aldi.

With all the conveniences offered, living near a mall can help reduce the stress levels often faced by urban dwellers. Easy access to various needs, entertainment, and public facilities makes daily life more efficient and enjoyable. This not only has a positive impact on your mental health but also improves your overall quality of life.

 Residences near malls in BSD City
One real-life example of housing that offers easy access and a high quality of life is the residential area in BSD City, managed by Sinar Mas Land. In this area, you can find various housing options close to modern open-concept malls, such as Eastvara.

Eastvara is the newest mall in BSD City, featuring modern and open architecture and offering a variety of attractive facilities. This mall is not only a shopping and culinary center but also equipped with aesthetic Instagram-worthy photo spots.

Eastvara is easily accessible through several toll roads, such as the Serpong-Balaraja Toll Section 1A, Jakarta-Merak Toll, Jakarta-Serpong Toll integrated with Kunciran-Serpong Toll, and JORR 2 Toll.`,
